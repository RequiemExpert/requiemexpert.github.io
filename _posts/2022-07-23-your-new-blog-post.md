Me

hello it is me again<br>
there is nothing much to do here and nothing to inform you about(moved places 186 days/6 months ago)<br>
i do not feel safe here<br>
not even a few months in and i already heard about accidents and holdups<br>
it is a very large place and the streets don't even have traffic lights, and the street near us went on the news<br>
<br>
i have been doing nothing much but play and exercise (inside)<br>
rarely because i don't even have my own room and large space to do so<br>
<br>
bruh this place is shit<br>
<br>
that's about it, see you in a few weeks/months<br>
