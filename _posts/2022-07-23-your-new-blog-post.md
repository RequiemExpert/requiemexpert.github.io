Me

hello it is me again
there is nothing much to do here and nothing to inform you about(moved places 186 days/6 months ago)
i do not feel safe here
not even a few months in and i already heard about accidents and holdups
it is a very large place and the streets don't even have traffic lights, and the street near us went on the news

i have been doing nothing much but play and exercise (inside)
rarely because i don't even have my own room and large space to do so

bruh this place is shit

that's about it, see you in a few weeks/months
