## Small Update
# June 5, 2022
I've just done an assignment that required me to do a video presentation.<br>
Man, those things are very hard to edit. The editing process is what's tiring.<br>
It took me 1 day just to finish a 1 minute and 34 second video. 1 day.<br>
To be fair, I was also thinking of what the content of my video would be, at the same time.<br>
I kept changing it up, from a certain medieval-style editing to a certain RPGMaker-style.<br>
The medieval style editing wasted a lot of my time.. but I still put it up as my intro.<br>
The rest is RPGMaker-style.<br>
Here's the video: https://youtu.be/sZZUsiZ2aAg<br>
and since I'm very tired (physically and mentally),
