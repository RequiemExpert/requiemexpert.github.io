## This is my first blog post
I was hesitant at first about making  a blog, since I don't even like most of them. For a long time.
Well, 3 years later from 6th grade.. Here I am now. In 9th grade and writing a blog at night.
A friend of mine, who happens to be pursuing the same course and as me (computer science), told me to treat it as a diary.
His advice worked, because otherwise I would not be writing this blog right now.

Ahh, in case you haven't seen, my name is Rein Linga, and I am currently in 9th grade.
I saw that on quora, a github blog will help with my resume, and that really pushed me into doing blogs.
This is my first one, and more will come soon.


# 8:00 AM (Science)
I answered the science quiz sent to us for twenty minutes. Some part of the answers were cut out,
but I still scored a perfect 10. I also happened to answer one of the cut-out parts which worried me since it might be wrong.
Haven't scored perfect in a long time in these rigged Google Forms quizzes. It felt so satisfying.
It was also observation day for my teacher, and she had some few last-minute(or hour) request.
A video which should contain the following:
Ako si _________, nais kong maging ___________ (propesyon o trabaho) sa hinaharap sapagkat_________________________.<br>
(I am ___________, I wish to become a __________ (profession or job) in the future because _______________________.)
It had a reward of "bonus 15 points in our summative test", so how could I say no? 
The bathroom was not a choice, so were the rooms either. Everyone was very noisy, so I went outside our house to record myself.
I think I did this for a very few minutes, as I don't recall it being 8:30 yet after coming back.
I don't remember what I used the rest of the minutes remaining, probably watched YouTube or anything else.

# 9:00 AM (TLE)
Ah, we also had an upcoming observation for our TLE class!
Just yesterday, we were practicing to speedbuild some diagrams.
It took us 20 minutes yesterday. That night, I tried to speedrun the diagram by myself.
I put on a music as a timer for me.
It took me 2 minutes to build all arrows and all boxes uncolored.
It was kinda unfair since I was just copy and pasting the previous things one by one and not creating the things by myself
Though after telling my groupmates about my strategy, it gave them some confidence boost.

This time, we practiced two times. It took us twelve minutes! Twelve! A speedrunner's dream indeed. 
If this was a game, we would have held the world record by now, since there were two laptop users in our team. (me and my classmate Manny)
That time, though, there were no assigned roles.
This time, our leader assigned roles.
It took us 8 minutes this time, and if this was also a game, not only would we have held the world record, but also break our personal best.
As 8 minutes was hard to beat.
We ended up finishing at roughly 9:50 and I just goofed off after that, since there was nothing left to do.
Our leader informed our teacher of our success, and asked if the same diagram would be used or if he was going to send a new one.
He ultimately decided to send the same diagram, probably because 8 minutes was very good.
He only assigned 5-7 minutes for the groupwork, and we were late by one minute. This will go well for us tomorrow.

# 10:15 AM (MAPEH)
Nothing important in particular, just read some Health modules and goofed off.

# 11:15 AM (Filipino)
Yes, I live in the Philippines.
There was a quiz we had to take about Noli me Tangere.
Was kinda late to the party, since I was playing Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
Ended up with a 9/10, with some help from the internet.
Then I suddenly lost the will to play Oblivion, maybe because Filipino time was about to end.
Like last hour, I probably just watched YouTube in my spare time.

# 12:45 PM (A.P)
The class schedule was switched. It was supposed to be math.
Well, today is class observation after all.
It had my hands become cold, probably nervous I would be called without even raising my hand.
At the start, there were some news reporting from my classmates. I forgot about this one.
Then, we played a game. Guess the Job by Emojis.
I got the first one, thanks to my expert typing skills.
The next ones, I did not.
I suspected foul play involved here. 
"Why were they faster than me?"
"What the hell is going on? I was just about to type in my first letter and someone's already answered."
I was probably right, as my friend also suspected it.
The video was in YouTube, and everyone could freely search it.
Oh well.

I did not recite that much as I did not remember much from the group reports,
since there was an echo happening from the screenshare.
I tried to do so two times, but I did not get chosen to answer.
Then, at the end of the presentation, in comes the videos.
Remember the video I sent earlier?
I did not look good in it. The camera was very near my face. (which happens to be wearing a mask, thank god)

Like earlier, I could not hear much because of the echo.
Then after the videos, we answered a live quiz.
I got decimated. Ended up in 13th but went up to 9th after a redemption question.
Seriously, what the hell are those? That's like borderline cheating.

Ended up with 6000+ points as opposed to the first to third places having 8000+.
And after that, it felt like the day ended.
Like, there was nothing more to do.
Which I was right.

# 1:45 PM (English)
Only sent attendance for us to react to.
man, that observation session left me fatigued..

# 3:00 PM (Math)
Was supposed to be math but
no one arrived.
Thank god

# 4:00 PM (Homeroom)
Also nothing
Thank you, thank you for letting us rest

# 5:00 PM (Class end)
