## This is my first blog post

I was hesitant at first about making  a blog, since I don't even like most of them. For a long time.<br>
Well, 3 years later from 6th grade.. Here I am now. In 9th grade and writing a blog at night.<br>
A friend of mine, who happens to be pursuing the same course and as me (computer science), told me to treat it as a diary.<br>
His advice worked, because otherwise I would not be writing this blog right now.<br>
<br>
Ahh, in case you haven't seen, my name is Rein Linga, and I am currently in 9th grade.<br>
I saw that on quora, a github blog will help with my resume, and that really pushed me into doing blogs.<br>
This is my first one, and more will come soon.<br>
Today is Thursday, June 2, 2022.<br>

# 8:00 AM (Science)
I answered the science quiz sent to us for twenty minutes. Some part of the answers were cut out,<br>
but I still scored a perfect 10. I also happened to answer one of the cut-out parts which worried me since it might be wrong.<br>
Haven't scored perfect in a long time in these rigged Google Forms quizzes. It felt so satisfying.<br>
It was also observation day for my teacher, and she had some few last-minute(or hour) request.<br>
A video which should contain the following:<br>
Ako si _________, nais kong maging ___________ (propesyon o trabaho) sa hinaharap sapagkat_________________________.<br>
(I am ___________, I wish to become a __________ (profession or job) in the future because _______________________.)<br>
It had a reward of "bonus 15 points in our summative test", so how could I say no? <br>
The bathroom was not a choice, so were the rooms either. Everyone was very noisy, so I went outside our house to record myself.<br>
I think I did this for a very few minutes, as I don't recall it being 8:30 yet after coming back.<br>
I don't remember what I used the rest of the minutes remaining, probably watched YouTube or anything else.<br>

# 9:00 AM (TLE)
Ah, we also had an upcoming observation for our TLE class!<br>
Just yesterday, we were practicing to speedbuild some diagrams.<br>
It took us 20 minutes yesterday. That night, I tried to speedrun the diagram by myself.<br>
I put on a music as a timer for me.<br>
It took me 2 minutes to build all arrows and all boxes uncolored.<br>
It was kinda unfair since I was just copy and pasting the previous things one by one and not creating the things by myself.<br>
Though after telling my groupmates about my strategy, it gave them some confidence boost.<br>
<br>
This time, we practiced two times. It took us twelve minutes! Twelve! A speedrunner's dream indeed. <br>
If this was a game, we would have held the world record by now, since there were two laptop users in our team. (me and my classmate Manny)<br>
That time, though, there were no assigned roles.<br>
This time, our leader assigned roles.<br>
It took us 8 minutes this time, and if this was also a game, not only would we have held the world record, but also break our personal best.<br>
As 8 minutes was hard to beat.<br>
We ended up finishing at roughly 9:50 and I just goofed off after that, since there was nothing left to do.<br>
Our leader informed our teacher of our success, and asked if the same diagram would be used or if he was going to send a new one.<br>
He ultimately decided to send the same diagram, probably because 8 minutes was very good.<br>
He only assigned 5-7 minutes for the groupwork, and we were late by one minute. This will go well for us tomorrow.<br>

# 10:15 AM (MAPEH)
Nothing important in particular, just read some Health modules and goofed off.<br>

# 11:15 AM (Filipino)
Yes, I live in the Philippines.<br>
There was a quiz we had to take about Noli me Tangere.<br>
Was kinda late to the party, since I was playing Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.<br>
Ended up with a 9/10, with some help from the internet.<br>
Then I suddenly lost the will to play Oblivion, maybe because Filipino time was about to end.<br>
Like last hour, I probably just watched YouTube in my spare time.<br>

# 12:45 PM (A.P)
The class schedule was switched. It was supposed to be math.<br>
Well, today is class observation after all.<br>
It had my hands become cold, probably nervous I would be called without even raising my hand.<br>
At the start, there were some news reporting from my classmates. I forgot about this one.<br>
Then, we played a game. Guess the Job by Emojis.<br>
I got the first one, thanks to my expert typing skills.<br>
The next ones, I did not.<br>
I suspected foul play involved here. <br>
"Why were they faster than me?"<br>
"What the hell is going on? I was just about to type in my first letter and someone's already answered."<br>
I was probably right, as my friend also suspected it.<br>
The video was in YouTube, and everyone could freely search it.<br>
Oh well.<br>
<br>
I did not recite that much as I did not remember much from the group reports,<br>
since there was an echo happening from the screenshare.<br>
I tried to do so two times, but I did not get chosen to answer.<br>
Then, at the end of the presentation, in comes the videos.<br>
Remember the video I sent earlier?<br>
I did not look good in it. The camera was very near my face. (which happens to be wearing a mask, thank god)<br>
<br>
Like earlier, I could not hear much because of the echo.<br>
Then after the videos, we answered a live quiz.<br>
I got decimated. Ended up in 13th but went up to 9th after a redemption question.<br>
Seriously, what the hell are those? That's like borderline cheating.<br>
<br>
Ended up with 6000+ points as opposed to the first to third places having 8000+.<br>
And after that, it felt like the day ended.<br>
Like, there was nothing more to do.<br>
Which I was right.<br>

# 1:45 PM (English)
Only sent attendance for us to react to.<br>
man, that observation session left me fatigued..<br>
<br>
# 3:00 PM (Math)
Was supposed to be math but<br>
no one arrived.<br>
Thank god<br>
<br>
# 4:00 PM (Homeroom)
Also nothing<br>
Thank you, thank you for letting us rest<br>
<br>
# 5:00 PM (Class end)
still very tired<br>
I played Roblox (Your Bizarre Adventure in particular) until I lost the will to do so.<br>
I got so bored that I fell asleep.<br>
<br>
and here I am, 4 hours after sleeping!<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading my first ever blog.<br>
I will continue to improve my blogs by trying to add pictures,<br>
letter effects/fonts, etc.<br>
